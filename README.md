Interactive Showcase Project
This project demonstrates a cutting-edge interactive showcase using a blend of technologies including React, Framer Motion for fluid animations, CSS3 for styling, Lottie for vector animations, Three.js for 3D model rendering, and GSAP for complex animation sequences. It's designed to provide an immersive experience where users can explore a 3D model from different angles, with smooth transitions and engaging animations.

Features
3D Model Viewing: Utilizes Three.js to render and interact with 3D models in real-time.
Fluid Animations: Integrates Framer Motion to apply smooth and natural animations for page transitions and interactive elements.
Vector Animations: Implements Lottie for high-quality, scalable vector animations that enhance the user interface.
Complex Animation Sequences: Employs GSAP for crafting sophisticated animation sequences for any DOM elements.
Responsive Design: Leverages CSS3 to ensure the application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across all devices.
